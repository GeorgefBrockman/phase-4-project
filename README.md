# Inventory and Sales Tracker

This fullstack application by Sasha Brockman mimics parts of a store Point of Sale system by keeping track of customers, transactions, and inventory. Included in this project is code for both the frontend and backend of this system. The frontend takes the shape of a web application with the ability to create new customers, transactions, and inventory and also displaying any information already in the database. The backend is a python-coded RESTful API that lays out the models accessed in the web page and also handles HTTP requests.
